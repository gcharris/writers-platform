# Reference Library - Canonical Source of Truth

**Updated:** November 11, 2024 (Phase 5 - Comprehensive Documentation)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all canonical reference materials

---

## Core Principle: No Duplication

**This is the ONLY place** for canonical reference materials. If you find character information, world-building details, or story structure in other locations, those are either:
- Copies for specific AI system use (e.g., AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/)
- Historical archives (e.g., Reference_Library/Archive/)
- Planning documents referencing these materials

**Always check here first** for authoritative information.

## How to Use This Library

### For AI Agents (Cursor AI, Claude Code):
1. **Always check here first** for canonical information
2. Read the appropriate subfolder (Characters/, World_Building/, etc.)
3. Do NOT duplicate information elsewhere
4. If updating character/world info, update HERE, then copy to AI_Systems if needed

### For Claude Desktop:
- Cannot access this folder directly (sandboxed)
- Curated copies uploaded to [AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base)
- Update Reference_Library first, then re-upload to Claude Desktop KB

### For Planning/Writing:
- Reference materials here inform Volume 2 planning docs
- Scene generation should pull from these canonical sources
- Character arcs and development notes reference these profiles

---

## Organization Principles

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
- Each piece of information exists in ONE canonical location
- Other locations either link to here or are copies with clear disclaimers

### 2. **Category-Based Organization**
- Files grouped by type (Characters, World_Building, etc.)
- Easy to find specific information
- Clear hierarchy

### 3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- All character profiles in Characters/
- All world-building in World_Building/
- All plot/structure in Story_Structure/
- All philosophy/themes in Themes_and_Philosophy/

### 4. **Archive Preservation**
- Old structures preserved with context READMEs
- Historical value maintained
- Clear migration documentation

---

## Relationship to Other Folders

### AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base/
- Contains **copies** of Reference_Library materials
- Curated for Claude Desktop sandboxed environment
- Upload checklist ensures proper KB setup

### Volume 2/Planning/
- **References** Reference_Library materials
- Does not duplicate character/world info
- Contains planning-specific docs (scaffolds, arcs, development notes)

### Volume 1/Reference/
- Historical - Volume 1 has its own reference structure
- Volume 1 completed before reorganization
- Not migrated to avoid disrupting finished work

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Information:
1. Determine category (Character, World_Building, Story_Structure, or Themes)
2. Add to appropriate subfolder in Reference_Library
3. Update any AI_Systems copies if needed
4. Do NOT create duplicate locations

### When Updating Existing Information:
1. Update in Reference_Library FIRST (source of truth)
2. Then propagate to AI_Systems if needed
3. Note update date in document

### When Archiving:
1. Move old versions to Reference_Library/Archive/
2. Create explanatory README in archive subfolder
3. Document why archived and where current version lives
