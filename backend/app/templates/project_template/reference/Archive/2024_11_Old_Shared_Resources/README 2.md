# Old Shared Resources Structure - ARCHIVED

**Archived:** November 11, 2024
**Reason:** Consolidated into Reference_Library organized structure

## What This Was

The "Shared Resources" folder was the original catch-all location for reference materials used across The Explants trilogy. It contained:

- Character profiles and backstories
- Style guides and voice documentation
- Technology explanations and world-building
- Setting descriptions (locations, facilities)
- Timeline and story structure documents
- Worldbuilding philosophy and themes
- Rewrite notes and development history

## Why Archived

The November 2024 reorganization consolidated these materials into a single source of truth with better organization:

### Structure Replaced By:

**[Reference_Library/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/Reference_Library)** - Canonical reference materials organized by category:

1. **[Characters/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/Reference_Library/Characters)** (from Shared Resources/Characters/)
   - Core_Cast/, Antagonists/, Supporting_Cast/, Relationships/
   - Single source of truth for all character information

2. **[World_Building/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/Reference_Library/World_Building)** (consolidated from multiple folders)
   - Locations/ (from Settings/)
   - Technology/ (from Technology/, Worldbuilding/tech/)
   - Includes immersion snapshots, world bible, tech primer

3. **[Story_Structure/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/Reference_Library/Story_Structure)** (from Timeline/, Reference/)
   - Plot summaries, character rosters, scene maps
   - Timeline and arc tracking

4. **[Themes_and_Philosophy/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/Reference_Library/Themes_and_Philosophy)** (from Worldbuilding/themes/)
   - Process vs particle philosophy
   - Consciousness themes
   - Ideological frameworks

**[AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base/](file:///Users/gch2024/Documents/Documents%20-%20Mac%20Mini/Explant%20drafts%20current/The%20Explants%20Series/AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base)** (from Style Guides/)
- Voice_and_Craft/ - Mickey voice guidelines, anti-patterns
- Organized for Claude Desktop KB upload

### Preserved at Root Level:

These folders were **NOT archived** and remain in Shared Resources/:
- **Loglines/** - Useful quick reference for trilogy elevator pitches
- **copyright/** - Legal reference materials

## Key Improvements

The new Reference_Library structure provides:

- **Single source of truth**: No duplication across folders
- **Better organization**: Category-based structure instead of flat dumping
- **Easier navigation**: Clear folder hierarchy
- **System-specific docs**: Voice/style materials in AI_Systems where they belong
- **Reduced confusion**: One place to look for each type of information

## Migration Map

| Old Shared Resources | New Location |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Characters/ | Reference_Library/Characters/ |
| Style Guides/ | AI_Systems/Claude_Desktop/Knowledge_Base/Voice_and_Craft/ |
| Technology/ | Reference_Library/World_Building/Technology/ |
| Settings/ | Reference_Library/World_Building/Locations/ |
| Worldbuilding/ | Reference_Library/World_Building/ & Themes_and_Philosophy/ |
| Timeline/ | Reference_Library/Story_Structure/ |
| Reference/ | Reference_Library/Story_Structure/ |
| rewrite notes Aug 2025/ | Reference_Library/Archive/ (historical development) |
| Loglines/ | **Preserved** in Shared Resources/ |
| copyright/ | **Preserved** in Shared Resources/ |

## Historical Value

This old Shared Resources structure is preserved because:
- Shows original organizational approach
- Contains development history (rewrite notes)
- May have fragments not yet consolidated (verify in Phase 6)
- Provides context for understanding project evolution
