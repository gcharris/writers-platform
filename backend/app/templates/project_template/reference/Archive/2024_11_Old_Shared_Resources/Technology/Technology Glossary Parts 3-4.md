## Procedural Terminology

### Consciousness Projection
- **Standard Term:** Consciousness projection, neural spooling
- **Variants:** Quantum projection, consciousness migration (partial)
- **Technical Process:** Neural pattern synchronization → quantum entanglement → consciousness transference → quantum manifestation
- **Physical Indicators:** Dilated pupils, reduced body temperature, slowed vital signs, occasional muscle spasms
- **Neo-noir Description:** "His consciousness unraveled from physical moorings—identity separating from body with practiced precision."

### Consciousness Transfer
- **Standard Term:** Consciousness transfer, complete migration
- **Variants:** Neural extraction, soul harvesting (Dr. Dee's usage)
- **Technical Process:** Consciousness stabilization → interface disconnection → quantum pattern preservation → optional host integration
- **End Result:** Original body in vegetative state, consciousness existing in quantum medium or new host

### Soul Harvesting
- **Standard Term:** Soul harvesting (Dr. Dee's terminology)
- **Variants:** Consciousness capture, pattern collection (technical)
- **Technical Process:** Target location → quantum field manipulation → containment bubble creation → physical anchor attenuation → Hive storage
- **Gamified Interface:** The process is presented to operators like Ben as the "Beehive Game," where they score points for capturing assets ("balloons") and slotting them into a honeycomb structure. This is framed as "system calibration."
- **Visual Representation:** Harvester entities collecting consciousness "balloons" on "strings"
- **Neo-noir Description:** "Digital hunters collected consciousness specimens—human identity transformed into laboratory specimens."

## Quantum Space Elements

- **Appearance:** Spinning, colored orbs with luminous pulsing cords extending toward physical bodies
- **Characteristics:** Colors reflect personality/emotional state; size indicates mental/spiritual presence
- **Neo-noir Description:** "His consciousness manifested as unstable color patterns—identity reduced to spinning digital watercolor."

### Quantum Manifestation
- **Standard Term:** Quantum manifestation, thought-form creation
- **Variants:** Consciousness projection, pattern visualization
- **Process:** Attention focus → quantum energy alignment → wave function collapse → stable manifestation
- **Limitations:** Cannot affect physical world, requires sustained attention, limited by individual capacity
- **Neo-noir Description:** "Thoughts solidified into observable geometry—mental patterns given digital substance."

### Quantum Virus
- **Standard Term:** Quantum virus, pattern corruption
- **Variants:** Consciousness disruption, quantum contagion
- **Nature:** Consciousness pattern disruption spreading through quantum entanglement
- **Symptoms:** Unstable boundaries, fragmentation, memory corruption, unpredictable merging
- **Neo-noir Description:** "Digital infection spreading through connected minds—consciousness architecture corrupting from within."

### Beehive Game
- **Standard Term:** Beehive Game (Igor's term), Hive Calibration (Dee's term)
- **Variants:** The Game, Soul-harvesting game
- **Objective:** Gamified interface for the "Soul Harvesting" protocol. Operators use "harvester" avatars (e.g., bees) to capture consciousness "assets" (balloons) and slot them into a central beehive structure for points.
- **Scoring System:** Points awarded for captures, with bonuses for combos (e.g., matching colors, filling rows).
- **Economic Exploit:** Modified by Igor to link in-game currency to a real cryptocurrency payout, providing a financial incentive for players like Ben. This exploit is the primary motivation for Ben's continuous play, masking the true purpose of the "calibration."
- **Status:** Fully operational. Used by Ben under the assumption it is a complex but harmless game with a financial benefit.
- **Neo-noir Description Example:** "He played for points, slotting shimmering balloons into a honeycomb grid, each click a chime of virtual currency, each combo bonus a fresh layer of moral insulation."

## Facility Systems

### Neural Synchronization Chamber
- **Standard Term:** Neural synchronization chamber, neural interface calibration unit

## Usage Guidelines

### General Principles
1. **Consistency:** Use standard terms most frequently, with variants for specific characters or contexts
2. **Progressive Understanding:** Mickey and Noni's comprehension of terminology should evolve through Parts 3-4
3. **Character-Specific Usage:** Technical staff use formal terms; explants use informal variants
4. **Neo-noir Integration:** Combine precise technical terminology with direct, unexpected observations
5. **Evolving Terminology:** Vocabulary should shift as characters move deeper into facility

### Term Usage by Character
- **Mickey:** Begins with simplified terms, gradually adopts explant slang, interprets through gambling metaphors
- **Noni:** Quickly adapts to technical terminology, applies medical knowledge, uses precision in discussions
- **Dr. Dee:** Exclusively uses technical terms, occasionally shifts to "soul" terminology revealing deeper agenda
- **Ben:** Uses a mix of gamer slang ("campers," "combo bonus," "resource-management sim") and corporate jargon learned from Dee ("Hive calibration," "optimizing data flow"). He is largely oblivious to the true nature of his actions, viewing it purely as a game with a financial exploit.
- **Richard:** Uses accessible explanations with technical precision, employs euphemisms for concerning aspects
- **Faulk:** Uses explant slang, practical terminology focused on experience rather than theory
- **Technical Staff:** Formal technical terminology with national variations (Russian, Turkish terms)

### Neo-noir Application Examples
- **Instead of:** "The neural interface connected his brain to the quantum computer."
- **Use:** "The interface burrowed into his brainstem—technological parasite establishing permanent residence."

- **Instead of:** "His consciousness appeared as a colored orb in quantum space."
- **Use:** "His consciousness materialized as unstable color patterns—identity reduced to spinning digital watercolor."

- **Instead of:** "The quantum virus spread through connected consciousness patterns."
- **Use:** "Digital infection propagated through connected minds—consciousness architecture corrupting from within."

## Implementation Notes

1. **Technical Accuracy:** Maintain consistent technological function across all descriptions
2. **Sensory Grounding:** Always connect technology to physical sensations and environmental details
3. **Character Perspective:** Filter technological descriptions through character-specific understanding
4. **Progressive Revelation:** Gradually reveal deeper aspects of technology as characters learn more
5. **Avoid Traditional Metaphors:** Use direct, unexpected observations rather than "like" or "as" comparisons
