The themes of self-perception and reflection are quite prominent in the narrative, especially for Mickey. The sources provide several explicit instances of mirrors, reflections, and refracted light, often used to underscore character identity, perception, and the blurring lines of reality.

Here are the scenes from the novel where mirrors, reflections, or refracted light are featured:

**Author's Preface (Post-events)**

- The "Enhanced Mickey" narrator, reflecting on his past self, states that "a man whose **fractured reflection mirrors** the collapsing boundary between mind and machine, self and other" begins the story, foreshadowing the themes of identity and technology.

**Part One, Chapter 1**

- After stealing cocaine, Mickey catches his image in a **flat, reflective surface** above Michael Jackson's mirror. He perceives it as "another **mirror, another distortion, another temporary escape from the face he couldn’t outrun**".
- Following his Sinatra performance, Mickey sees himself in **a reflection in a window**, noting he is "just the echo, not the voice—the reflection, not the light".
- While hiding in the casino, Mickey's gaze snags on a **fractured reflection from a nearby chrome panel**, which fragments his likeness into "infinite versions of himself".
- At the Sunset Park playground, two judo kids are drawn to **funhouse mirrors**. One boy observes his own reflection "shed its grin" in a flat mirror, complaining about seeing himself "as ya really are".
- When Mickey takes a rock from the boy, his own reflection **mirrors the heft** of the rock, and he sees "Two Mickeys look into each other’s eyes".
- Behind his reflection, Mickey sees "echoes of his father’s face".
- When Mickey throws the rock at the funhouse mirror, it "fractured into concentric waves that distorted rather than shattered—**reality bending but refusing to break** under the impact".

**Part One, Chapter 2**

- At the UN Science & Technology Committee, Ambassador Volodina pauses near a window overlooking the East River, her **reflection ghosted against the glass**.
- Later, in Julian Vance's estate, light from a **picture window refracted a prismatic radiance** that danced across the walls and ceiling.
- As Igor departs Vance's estate in a helicopter, **Ben’s reflection appears in the window beside his own**, showing "two figures under the same invisible thumb".

**Part One, Chapter 3**

- At a blackjack table, the casino lights catch the **gold flecks in Cheri’s eyeliner, tiny mirrors reflecting Mickey’s own hunger** back at him.

**Part One, Chapter 5**

- After his encounter with Cheri, Mickey’s gaze catches on a **small decorative mirror** before he quickly looks away, "unwilling to confront what he might see there".

**Part One, Chapter 8**

- Mickey checks his appearance in the **rearview mirror** of Cheri's car, seeing his "default face—handsome but hard".
- At the gas station, Mickey catches his face in the **gas station window**, seeing "no Sinatras, no fathers, no other Mickeys—just one hard, desperate stranger".
- The Goth girl joins Mickey in the **mirrored window**, making the stranger become two. Mickey recognizes "the wariness of someone who had learned early that nothing comes without a price".
- Later, the **window catches Mickey's reflection** in the car, showing "another fragmented version of himself, distorted by city light and morning glare".
- Looking in the **side mirror**, Mickey catches a final glimpse of Sadie, seeing her "shrinking figure" distorted, "another fragment of himself left behind—a receding shard in the glass".
- At the martial arts school, the **trophy case glass offers another reflection**, "this one crueler than before," juxtaposing his "ravaged present overlaid on a preserved past".

**Part Two, Chapter 9**

- In his office at UNRCAC, Richard looks at a framed photograph of his original research team, preserving "a certainty that had slipped from his grasp".
- During his time in rehab, Mickey observes his "face in the glass" of a window, which looks back "still Mickey, but defanged".
- After his breakthrough in rehab, Mickey stands in the empty hallway, and his **reflection in the window stares back**—"hollowed but no longer shaking".

**Part Two, Chapter 12**

- In the SUV, Mickey’s **reflection in the side mirror** reveals "a face he no longer trusted".

**Part Three, Chapter 19**

- After his drunken fight with Noni, Mickey catches sight of himself in the **mirror mounted on the door**. He sees "Disheveled, eyes unfocused, mouth still formed around lyrics with no audience".
- With sudden violence, Mickey smashes his fist into the mirror. For a split second, the **broken glass shows more than reflections**: "Noni’s consciousness trapped in crystalline fragments, her real self scattered across infinite digital mirrors while something else wore her body. His own identity fracturing the same way—Mickey Bardot becoming empty vessel for whoever Dee chose to pour inside".

**Part Three, Chapter 20**

- Mickey experiences a vision where his **reflection shimmers, transforming** into "Mickey’s face with an an**tenna protruding from the back of his skull, eyes vacant, movements mechanical**" before returning to normal.

**Part Five, Chapter 29**

- In their "quantum honeymoon" after their ordeal, Noni looks up at her **reflection in the mirrored ceiling** of their quantum-constructed bedroom, conveying "simple pleasure in seeing herself—whole, connected, alive—in this shared reality".

These instances are crucial for illustrating the novel's overarching themes of **identity, authenticity, and perception**, often linking Mickey's internal struggles with his external experiences and the nature of the quantum realm. The recurring motif of **mirrors and fractured reflections** symbolizes his fragmented self and the pervasive surveillance he constantly faces, both physically and technologically.
