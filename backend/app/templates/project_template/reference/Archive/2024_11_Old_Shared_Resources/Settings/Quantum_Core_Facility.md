## Neo-Noir Style Reference
- **Sensory Precedent from Part 1:** "Oxygen-enriched air carried traces of perfume, cigarettes, and desperation."
- **Neo-Noir Adaptation:** "Superconductor matrix equipment HISSED periodically, releasing luminescent vapor in rhythmic exhalations that gave the machinery an almost respiratory quality, each release carrying a faint scent of ozone and liquid helium."
- **Sentence Rhythm Precedent:** "Six and five. Eleven. The table erupted."
- **Neo-Noir Adaptation:** "Consciousness migration complete. Signature stable. The matrix accepted."
- **Metaphorical Precedent:** "A fractured reflection caught his eye from a nearby chrome panel—his borrowed face distorted into three misaligned versions of himself."
- **Neo-Noir Adaptation:** "The quantum consciousness core pulsed with possibilities—a roulette wheel spinning endless realities, each one promising the ultimate win."
