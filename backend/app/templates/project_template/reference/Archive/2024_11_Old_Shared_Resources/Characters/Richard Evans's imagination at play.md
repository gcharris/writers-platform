Richard Evans's imagination at play:

- In the basement of Wong's laundry, despite dismissing the idea of Chinese sabotage, his mind conjures "a long line up of trebouchets, with armies of spies hurling rocks and Chinese soldiers flinging large laundry bags, slowly breaching the walls of the facility". This vision continues with "little sack men carrying their laundry bags out through the breaches in the wall," illustrating his deep-seated anxiety about the security of his research.
- Just before entering Wong's Laundry, Richard also experiences a moment where an elderly Chinese woman "disappeared. Just like that," prompting a "strange tingling sensation down the back of his neck" and an involuntary scan of his surroundings, suggesting a possible glitch in his perception or reality.

Here are other instances from the manuscript where Richard's rich imagination takes over:

- **Emotional Resonance:** After reflecting on a challenging week, he internally compares his heightened emotional state to the experiences reported by his research subjects, the "Explants," describing it as "almost like a drug: he'd been so 'up', so excited" and "being at one with the higher self, in the zone". This shows his deep, almost visceral, connection to his research.
- **Cynical Interpretations:** When an intelligence officer like Ken poses questions about his work, Richard cynically interprets this as leading to "some convenient fairy tale about a quantum computer virus," hinting at his early distrust of external interference.
- **Absurd Impulses:** While fuming about the violation of his research center, Richard, typically compassionate, finds himself contemplating an uncharacteristic act: "Richard, the kind of driver who would stop and help a snail cross the road, almost intentionally aimed at large cat laying comfortably on the asphalt". This fleeting, dark impulse contrasts sharply with his usual demeanor.
- **Self-Deprecating Metaphor:** He imagines himself as "a tube of toothpaste being squeezed in the basement of the Chinese laundry" when he realizes the extent of the geopolitical manipulation he's caught in, vividly illustrating his feeling of being pressured and used.
- **Childhood Echoes:** Richard interprets the ethical forms and demands for his signature as a "confession" for a "crime he didn't commit," linking his current predicament to a distant memory from his youth where "the school bully had walked free," revealing how past experiences shape his understanding of present injustices.
- **The Pen as a Weapon:** As he faces the grim task of signing away control, he visualizes his pen "poised like a loaded weapon." This perception quickly shifts to a more elaborate image of "the instrument dancing across documents with mechanical precision, the sorcerer's apprentice fulfilling commands he'd never issued," portraying his acute sense of lost agency.
- **Champagne Cork Metaphor:** Upon realizing the inevitable loss of his project, Richard internally "witnessed the champagne bottle's explosion--himself as cork, launched toward the ceiling by forces beyond his control," a powerful and self-identifying metaphor for his powerlessness.
- **Brain Under Siege:** He describes the overwhelming pressure and conflicting demands on his mind as "the dozen competing knitting needles spiking through his woolen ball of a brain," a vivid and tactile image of his mental stress.

**Background on this Character Trait:**

Richard Evans is introduced as a visionary "prophet of a techno-future he still believed he controlled," driven by an idealistic dream of "unified intelligence" and "elevating consciousness" to end ignorance and conflict. He is portrayed as an "idealist with a highly tuned intuition".

However, as his utopian vision clashes with the harsh realities of geopolitical maneuvering and military control, his imagination often becomes a coping mechanism. It's a way for his mind to process the overwhelming and often absurd pressures exerted upon him. His internal imagery tends to be:

- **Metaphorical:** He frequently uses vivid comparisons (toothpaste, champagne cork, knitting needles) to describe his emotional and mental state.
- **Self-Referential:** Many of his internal images reflect his loss of control, his perceived helplessness, or connect to his past experiences.
- **Absurdist/Darkly Humorous:** At times, his imagination veers into the absurd (trebuchets, aiming at a cat), highlighting the surreal nature of his situation and the breakdown of his rational control.

This imaginative capacity allows him to maintain a degree of internal processing, even as external events spiral beyond his grasp. It underscores the profound psychological impact of having his life's work appropriated and his ethical boundaries challenged, forcing his mind into often fantastical scenarios to make sense of an increasingly unbelievable reality.
