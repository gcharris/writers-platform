## Igor Zaitsev: Backstory & Character Arc

### Snapshot

- **Name:** Prof. **Igor Zaitsev**
- **Age:** 34
- **Role:** Visiting Fellow, International Neuromorphic Research Institute (INRI) / Chief Theorist, Russian delegation
- **Expertise:** Neuromorphic mathematics; inventor of the *Fractal‑Flux Topology* that allows low‑compute spiking‑neuron chips to emulate large‑scale transformer attention.

### Public Persona vs Private Self

| Facet           | Public‑facing                                                | Private reality                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Demeanour**   | Gregarious, cracks jokes, hammy accent when playing to the room | Switches to elegant, idiomatic English/Russian when discussing theory; ruthlessly methodical in code |
| **Motivation**  | “Democratising AI for all nations” – sells collaboration narrative | Vindication of Russian mathematics; personal glory; covert mandate from Moscow to secure leverage |
| **Moral shade** | Projects humanist ideals                                     | Torn: genuine wish to aid prosthetic BCI roll‑out in rural Russia **vs** readiness to compromise ethics for national gain |

### Core Talents & Props

- **Fractal‑Flux Algorithm:** compresses attention into recursive spike trains; runs on commodity neuromorphic cores.
- **Signature prop:** titanium thumb‑drive shaped like a Matryoshka doll – contains micro‑compiler/back‑door.
- **Visual motif in Q‑space:** snowfall of Cyrillic glyphs that cluster around anomalies.

### Relationship Web

- **Amb. Irina Volodin (Russia):** handler & political shield.
- **Liang Chen (China):** offers GPUs for algorithm in covert swap.
- **Mickey / Noni:** unexpected moral mirrors – force Igor to confront human cost.
- **Ken (CIA):** begins tracing firmware anomalies, becomes antagonist.

### Act‑by‑Act Arc

| Act      | Igor’s function                                   | Key turning points                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| I        | Name‑drop in UN session; distant genius           | Pride swells when Volodin cites his latency slide           |
| II‑a     | Arrives at UN facility as Visiting Fellow         | Plants micro‑compiler; bonds with Noni over prosthetics lab |
| II‑b     | Realises weaponisation plan                       | Diary entry reveals crisis of conscience                    |
| III      | Demo spirals; Igor alone can kill runaway process | Sacrifices algorithm (or doesn’t) → defines end state       |
| Epilogue | Defects / returns in disgrace / martyrdom         | Sets sequel stakes                                          |
