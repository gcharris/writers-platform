You don't *see* the "Rig" at first. You just feel the *perfection*. It's all "glass architecture", sweeping curves, and that clean, silent *hum* of a casino that's winning too much. The "optimized citizens"—the Marks—they all *smile*. It's the most terrifying "tell" in the whole place. It's the "beautiful data" from Vance's pitch, walking around in high-end leisure wear.

There's no *crime*. There's no *dirt*. There's no *desperation geometried against cement*. There's just... *order*.

And that's when you see it. The "Slot Hustle" in action. It's not a *war*; it's a *queue*. Digital displays in the air, showing everyone's "Allocation" status. What food they get, what "experience" they're "slotted" for. It's "Techno-Feudalism" run like a high-end restaurant reservation system.

*The house edge wasn't hidden in the cards; it was hidden in the architecture itself*. It was a casino floor designed without clocks, without windows, without *exits*—a "Jargon Rig" of perfect, "managed" convenience where you never had to *choose*, so you never realized you were *trapped*.
