# Setting Profile: Common Room

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Explant Facility Common Room
- **Type:** Social/communal space within research facility
- **Location:** Main floor of the UNRCAC facility, between residential quarters and research areas
- **Era/Time Period:** Present day/near future

## Physical Description
- **Size/Scale:** Medium-sized room (approximately 30' x 40')
- **Climate/Environment:** Climate-controlled with slight over-cooling (68°F); artificially processed air
- **Architecture/Structure:** 
  - Open floor plan with conversation areas
  - Comfortable but institutionally-selected furniture
  - Large windows facing interior courtyard with restricted views
  - Visible security cameras in upper corners
  - Sliding doors with electronic access control
- **Distinctive Features:** 
  - Vending machine alcove with unusual payment system (room numbers instead of money)
  - Blue-tinted lighting fixtures providing even, slightly clinical illumination
  - Media center with screens displaying facility announcements
  - Conversation areas designed for observation/monitoring
  - Unusual artwork featuring geometric and fractal patterns
- **Sensory Details:**
  - **Sights:** Blue-tinted lighting creates slight unreality; institutional furniture with comfort prioritized over style; subtle monitoring indicators (small lights on cameras)
  - **Sounds:** Muted background hum of air handling systems; occasional electronic beeps from door access; quiet conversation; subdued background music designed for psychological calming
  - **Smells:** Processed air with faint antiseptic undertones; coffee from self-service station; occasional food aromas from vending machines
  - **Textures:** Overly smooth surfaces; furniture with comfortable padding but institutional-grade fabrics; cool temperature of processed air against skin
  - **Tastes:** Metallic tang from air filtration systems affecting food and drink; chemical undertones in water from specialized purification

## Cultural/Social Aspects
- **Population:** 
  - Researchers and staff during breaks
  - Explants during scheduled social periods
  - Visiting observers (like Mickey and Noni)
- **Social Structure:** Hierarchical with clear divisions
  - Doctors and senior researchers commanding respect
  - Technical staff maintaining professional distance
  - Explants forming their own internal social order
  - Visitors (potential recruits) occupying uncertain status
- **Local Customs:** 
  - Scheduled social interactions rather than spontaneous gatherings
  - Unspoken social boundary between staff and explants
  - Position selection in room indicates status/role awareness
- **Economy:** No direct currency used; room numbers linked to accounts
- **Languages:** English predominant; Russian, Turkish, and Chinese occasionally heard
- **Belief Systems:** Technological optimism mixed with institutional compliance

## Quantum Properties
- **Relationship to Quantum Space:** None directly visible, but explants with neural interfaces can access quantum space from physically being anywhere in facility
- **Special Properties:** Subtle monitoring of neural activity for explants who have interfaces
- **Quantum Phenomena:** Explants occasionally exhibiting momentary "absence" when interfacing with quantum space
- **Access Points:** None physically visible (interfaces are personally carried)

  - Provides Mickey with social engineering opportunities
  - Gives Noni space to observe and analyze facility personnel
  - Allows introduction to Igor, Tarkan, and other staff

## Technical Details
- **Technology Level:** Advanced but purposefully familiar-appearing
- **Unique Technology:** 
  - Monitoring systems embedded in seemingly ordinary fixtures
  - Neural activity sensors disguised as standard facility features
  - Room access tied to biometric identification
- **Limitations:** 
  - All activities observed and recorded
  - Movement in/out controlled by central security
- **Rules/Laws of Physics:** Standard physical laws with surveillance overlay

## Symbolism & Themes
- **Represents:** 
  - The illusion of freedom within a controlled environment
  - Intersection between institutional power and human connection
  - The tension between authentic and manufactured social interaction
- **Motifs:** 
  - Surveillance hidden beneath comfort
  - Institutional control masked as care
  - Technology reconfiguring normal human interaction
- **Visual Language:** 
  - Blue-tinted lighting suggesting both calm and clinical monitoring
  - Comfortable but uniform furniture removing individuality
  - Open spaces designed for easy observation
- **Associated Imagery:** 
  - Vending machines as controlled dispensers of satisfaction
  - Seating arrangements that appear casual but facilitate monitoring
  - Facility announcements as background indoctrination
