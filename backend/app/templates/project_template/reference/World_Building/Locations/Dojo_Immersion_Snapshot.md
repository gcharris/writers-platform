### 4. The Dojo Immersion Snapshot
**(Zhao's Place / The Obligation)**

**VOICE=Enhanced | PHASE=4 | METAPHOR=Martial Arts/Casino/The Leash**

You don't *smell* the dojo first. You *remember* it. Sweat woven into worn mats, Tiger Balm unlocking muscle memory decades deep, the electric hum of fluorescent lights that used to feel like stage lighting when I was the star. Now they just buzz—a reminder that every performance has a closing night.

The "Awards Wall" is still there. My teenage face, frozen in a championship photo—*before and after*, except I haven't figured out which one I'm looking at. That kid had authentic wins. I've got authentic obligations.

Ken didn't just *buy* the dojo when Zhao got sick. He bought my *leash*. Gave me the money to "save" it, to "fix it up," to "take over." Painted it like a *gift*. It's the most elegant con I've ever been on the wrong side of—he saved Zhao's legacy, gave me a *purpose*, and all I have to do in return is be his "eyes and ears" in quantum space.

It's not a cage. It's a *dojo*. There's a difference. A cage, you want to escape. A dojo? You *owe* it something. You owe the *teacher* something. And now that teacher is bedridden, and Ken's check cleared, and every mat I walk across reminds me: I'm not here because I *chose* this. I'm here because refusing would mean watching Zhao lose everything.

*It wasn't a "cage" anymore. It was **"silk-wrapped obligation"**. He'd bought my past, renovated my guilt, and hung them both on the wall next to that championship photo. The house edge wasn't hidden in the cards—it was hidden in gratitude itself.*
