**I. Noni's \*Real\* V1 "Grit" (The `1.8.2 Hotel` Voice)**

- **She's Not a "Hippie"; She's a \*Fugitive\*.** This is the *core* of her character. She's on the run. She *killed* (euthanized) her own brother, Thomas. That's her "murder charge". She's not some "meditation girl"; she's a "Buddhist biker" with a "spine" of steel.
- **She's My \*Counter-Con\*.** She's the *only* one in V1 who reads *me*. On the plane, she *sees* my con. She calls my bluff on the "fifth step". She's not a "Mark"; she's a *player*.
- **She's an \*Intuitive\* Genius.** I've got my "Musical Mathematics"; she's got her "Morphic Resonance". In the "Q-Space", she's the one who *stabilizes* me. Her "mantra" *is* "applied quantum field theory". She's the "harmonic anchor".
- **Her "Tell" is \*Compassion\*.** She's the one who leads the "quantum rebellion"... not with *violence*, but with *love*. She turns the "explants" into *hearts*. That's her "superpower".

**II. Noni's V2 Arc (The "Toxic Link")**

- **The "Weaponized Compassion" Con:** This is her *entire* V2 story. Ken *knows* her "superpower" is her empathy. So he turns it into a *leash*.
- **The "Moral Trap":** He uses her "morphic resonance" as "involuntary surveillance technology". He *makes* her feel the "exponential... consciousness trafficking victims". It's "engineered emotional overwhelm". She *can't* say no, because she's the only one who can *feel* them.
- **Her \*Real\* Conflict (with Me):** She *feels* my "addiction" *and* my "temptation" by Vance. It's not a *disagreement*; it's a "toxic link". My "seduction" is *poison* to her.
- **Her "Consciousness as Verb" Philosophy:** She is the *only* one who can call Vance's bluff. She's the one who looks at his "beautiful data" and asks the "A-plus" question: **"Zero crime... or zero choice?"**
