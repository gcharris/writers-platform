### The Explants: Character Roster

**1. Mickey Bardot (also Mickey Bardot (Enhanced), Young Mickey, He-Man, Sinatra, Pinocchio)**

- **Description:** Initially a con man, performer, and addict with an "almost pathological aversion to genuine connection". He was analog, driven by instinct, impulse, biological wetware, and bad decisions. He had a knack for impersonation and spent his life reading "tells and playing angles". He was physically capable, described as having an athletic build from disciplined training, and was once a professional pitcher until he was banned. He often used sarcasm and humor as defense mechanisms. After his "brain job," he became a **fusion** of computational prowess and raw experiential knowledge, operating in digital spaces, processing emotions like data, and translating human experience into quantum probabilities. He can infer motivations and reconstruct internal states with "quantum-enhanced diagnostic" precision. The "Enhanced" Mickey Bardot, who narrates the preface, considers his former self a data set he can analyze, no longer the "I" writing the story.

  - In the quantum world, he rallied the captured consciousnesses through his performance of "That's Life," creating a "quantum rebellion".
  - He defeated Dee in the quantum realm (as He-Man against Skeletor) and in the physical world by extracting Dee's implant.
  - He survived and, with Noni, became a "quantum pioneer," a guardian of the quantum realm from a hidden facility under Ken's oversight.
