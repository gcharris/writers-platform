# Explants Voice Gold Standard

## Core Principle: Cognitive Fusion

**Definition:** The reader experiences the character's consciousness directly, without an observing narrator.

**Test:** Can you remove "she thought" from any sentence without losing meaning?
- ❌ Bad: *I need to leave*, she thought. (Italics + thought tag = observer split)
- ✅ Good: She needed to leave. (Direct consciousness)

## Voice Authenticity Criteria

### 1. Observer vs Consciousness War
The fundamental tension in limited POV writing.

**Observer Mode:** External narrator describing
- "She felt angry"
- "He noticed the door was open"
- "She thought about her options"

**Consciousness Mode:** Direct experience
- "The bastard"
- "The door. Open."
- "Three options, all bad"

**Goal:** 80%+ consciousness mode in Phase 2+

### 2. Thought Presentation

**Phase 1 (Learning):**
- Can use some thought tags
- Some observer language acceptable
- Focus on clarity over craft

**Phase 2 (Professional):**
- Minimize thought tags
- Primarily consciousness mode
- Some observer language for transitions

**Phase 3 (Advanced):**
- No thought tags except rare emphasis
- Pure consciousness immersion
- Observer language only for physical facts

### 3. Filter Word Elimination

**Filter words** create distance:
- saw, heard, felt, noticed, realized, thought, wondered

**Instead of:**
- "She saw the blood on the floor"

**Write:**
- "Blood on the floor"

**When filter words are acceptable:**
- When perception itself is significant
- When timing matters: "She didn't notice the blood until..."
- When emphasis needed: "She SAW it—really saw it"

## Voice Consistency Tests

### Test 1: Can You Film It?
If you can't film it, it might be telling.
- ❌ "She felt confused" (can't film feelings)
- ✅ "She frowned, looking from door to door" (can film this)

### Test 2: Remove Filter Words
Delete "saw/heard/felt/noticed" - does it still work?
- Original: "She saw the gun"
- Filtered: "The gun"
- Does it work? Yes = good voice

### Test 3: Italics Check
Every use of italics should be challenged.
- Is this character actually thinking in complete sentences?
- Would direct narration be stronger?
